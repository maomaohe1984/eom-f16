  <p>For this assignment you will be choosing a meaningful dataset or API and creating an interactive data visualization with it. In the design world, data visualization means to communicate aspects of a dataset through visuals and text. In the art world designing with data can be more abstract, a dataset can simple be used to influence some visual aspects of a visual design. It is up to you to take either approach, or something in between.</p>
  
  <p>Consider typography (choice of font, font size), color (color of fonts, color of graphical elements), size (emphasis, comparison), icons, shape (comparison). Think about themes, should the content of the data influence the aesthetics of the visualization? Change your dataset, how does this influence your visuals? As numbers increase in your dataset, what happens in your visuals? As numbers decrease, how does this affect your visuals?</p>
  
  <p>You may also choose to have sound output instead of visuals, as long of you have a meaningful mapping between your data and your output.</p>
