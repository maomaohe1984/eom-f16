  <p>Create an audio/visual musical instrument.The instrument should make sound and display visuals based on user interaction (mouse movements, key presses, etc). Make sure that interactions and their outcomes are predictable enough that a user can practice and become proficient at “playing” your instrument (i.e it cannot be too random). Your instrument can trigger snippets or sound files, or generate sound algorithmically.</p>
  <p>Once you have a working prototype, invite at least two people to interact with it (preferably, not fellow DMI students). Document these interactions visually, and make notes on how your users experienced your piece.</p>
