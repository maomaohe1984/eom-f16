  <p>Create a digital mirror which reflects a user’s form while creating an interactive and aesthetically interesting experience. Consider integrating sound, kinetic and dynamic forms using the image processing and analysis techniques we’ve explored. Consider the narrative of the experience you are trying to create for your users. How does the experience unfold over time?</p>
  
  <p>Install your digital mirror in a public location. Document, using stills and video, users interacting with your creation.</p>
