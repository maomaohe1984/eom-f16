  <p>Create an aesthetic and expressive visual experience that is responsive to user interaction, time-of-day and current temperature. The sketch does not need to be a clock per-se, but it should respond in some way to the outside variable of the time of day.</p>
  <p>Consider the context of your TimeKeeper. Consider a location where it should be installed. What kinds of people would visit it? How does the location influence your design, how will your TimeKeeper change the location? Install your TImeKeeper at this location.</p>

    Adapted from the <i>Brian Lucid's</i>, <i>Alison Kotin's</i> and <i>Nicole Tariverdian's</i> various clock assignments.
